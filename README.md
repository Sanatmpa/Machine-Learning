This branch contains all my works with Amazon fine foods dataset downloaded from below Kaggle link.

I used this as a toy dataset to learn all the classical machine learning algorithms( KNN , Naive bayes, Logistic regression, SVM, Random forest, GBDT , K-means, Agglomerative clustering, DBSCAN) and deep learning algorithms like RNN(LSTM). I performed indepth analysis of different ML algorithms in the above notebooks. Feel free to check them out.
